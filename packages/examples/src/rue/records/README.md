## ActiveRecord classes

This directory is where you store classes that inherit from `ActiveRecord`.  
The files generated by default are the following files.

- Account
- Profile
- Task

If it is only a file, it will be generated by the following command.


```bash
{
  rue generate -f -s ./src/rue/records record Account "fullName:string, email:string"
  rue generate -f -s ./src/rue/records record Profile "firstName:string, lastName:string"
  rue generate -f -s ./src/rue/records record Task "content:string"
}
```
